Effective use of AI coding assistants can speed up and improve the software development process through rapid code generation, iteration, experimentation, and a modern take on test-driven development (TDD). Apply AI tools to build and expand coding projects, create new components by generating fit-for-purpose boilerplate code, validate projects with AI-generated tests, automatically document and expand projects, and more. The course covers building new projects from scratch as well as using AI to upgrade and refactor existing codebases.

Learning objectives
- Evaluate the capabilities of various AI coding assistants and integrate them into the software development workflow to enhance productivity and code quality.
- Design and implement code components, leveraging AI tools to generate code templates, expand functionality, and build new features from developer instructions.
- Analyze existing codebases, using AI-driven refactoring techniques to optimize code structure, update legacy code to modern standards, and improve overall maintainability.
- Develop test cases and apply test-driven development (TDD) methodologies with AI assistants, generating comprehensive tests and validating code functionality to ensure reliability.
- Iterate on different coding approaches and solutions, using AI tools to explore alternative implementations, refine code, and innovate beyond conventional programming paradigms.

## Instructions
This repository is a starting point for your exploration. It provides a baseline React.js application running on Vite, found in the `./chatty-app/` folder. As you follow along in chapter 2, you can use this project to experiment with the same prompts and techniques demonstrated in the course.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The exercise files found in the `./chatty-app/` folder do not porgress with the course. The folder is a starting point for your exploration, and as you use AI coding tools, your code will be different than what you see in the course. You do not need to match the code in the course exactly, and you can use the `./chatty-app/` folder as a sandbox to experiment in any way you like.



## Installing
To run the app in the `./chatty-app/` folder:
1. Navigate to the `./chatty-app/` folder in your terminal.
```bash
cd chatty-app
```
2. Install the dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the development server.
```bash
npm run dev
```
4. Click the pop-up button or click the `localhost` link in terminal to view the app in a new browser tab.
5. To stop the development server, type `q` in the terminal and press `Enter`.
