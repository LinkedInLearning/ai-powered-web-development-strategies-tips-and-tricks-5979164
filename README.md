# AI-Powered Web Development: Strategies, Tips, and Tricks
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `AI-Powered Web Development: Strategies, Tips, and Tricks`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

## Instructions
This repository is a starting point for your exploration. It provides a baseline React.js application running on Vite, found in the `./chatty-app/` folder. As you follow along in chapter 2, you can use this project to experiment with the same prompts and techniques demonstrated in the course.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The exercise files found in the `./chatty-app/` folder do not porgress with the course. The folder is a starting point for your exploration, and as you use AI coding tools, your code will be different than what you see in the course. You do not need to match the code in the course exactly, and you can use the `./chatty-app/` folder as a sandbox to experiment in any way you like.



## Installing
To run the app in the `./chatty-app/` folder:
1. Navigate to the `./chatty-app/` folder in your terminal.
```bash
cd chatty-app
```
2. Install the dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the development server.
```bash
npm run dev
```
4. Click the pop-up button or click the `localhost` link in terminal to view the app in a new browser tab.
5. To stop the development server, type `q` in the terminal and press `Enter`.
